Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both 
weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#print (type(height))
#print (type(weight))
height_int = (float(height))
weight_int = (float(weight))
#print (type(height_int))
#print (type(weight_int))
BMI_cal = weight_int / (height_int * height_int)
#print (BMI_cal)
BMI = int(BMI_cal)
print (BMI)

#Type is used to see what format the input is saved in - it was saved as a string
#Change the variable type to a float which can handle decimal points
#Carry out calculations according to the formula
#Turn the answer back into an integer which will make it a whole number

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")

years_left = death - age_int
z = (str(years_left * 12))
#print (z)

y = (str(years_left * 52))
#print (y)

x = (str(years_left * 365))
#print (x)

print ("You have " + (x) + " days, " + (y) + " weeks, and " + (z) + " months left.")

#Age input variable is recorded as a string
#Convert age into an integer called age_int
#Set the death age to 90
#Calculate how many years are left by subtracting the age from the death date
#Multiply the number of years left with 12 to get the total amount of months remaining and convert it into a string and save it as variable z
#Multiply the number of years left with 52 to calculate the number of weeks left - convert into a string and saved as variable y
#Multiply the number of years left with 365 to calculate the number of days left - convert into a string and saved as variable x
#Create a print statement to import all the calculated variables
