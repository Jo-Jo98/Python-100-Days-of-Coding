#Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

#It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

#Under 18.5 they are underweight
#Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#Above 35 they are clinically obese.

#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
#Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. 
#e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
BMI_cal = weight/ (height ** 2) 
#print(f"{weight} % ({height} x {height}) = {BMI_cal}")
BMI_whole_num = round(BMI_cal)

#Write a program that works out whether a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, and leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
#This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

#e.g. The year 2000:

#2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
#2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
#2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
#So the year 2000 is a leap year.

#But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
#2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
#2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
#2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

if (year%400 == 0) and (year%4 == 0):
    print ('Leap year.')
else:
    if (year%4 == 0) and (year%100 == 0):
        print ('Leap year.')
    else:
        if (year%4 == 0):
            print ('Leap year.')
        else:
                print('Not leap year.')
