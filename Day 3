#2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

#Love Calculator

You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occur. 
Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occur. 
Then combine these numbers to make a 2-digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
"Your score is **z**."

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# Concatenate the two names and change the names into lowercase so that proper validation and count can be carried out. 
str1 = name1.lower()+name2.lower()

#Count each specific letter in the string and save the number in its variable.
var_t = str1.count('t')

num_true_total = var_t + var_r + var_u + var_e
#Convert the number into a string.
num_true_total =str(num_true_total)

#Count each specific letter in the string and save the number in its variable. We have already done "e" so no need to 
#calculate it again.
var_l = str1.count('l')

#Add all the numbers together and save them in a new variable.

#Convert the number into a string.
love_total = str(love_total)
#Because both numbers are now saved as a string/text, we can concatenate them and save them into a new variable
true_love = (num_true_total) + (love_total)
#Again we need to change the string back into a number which would allow us to see if set criteria is met.
num_true_love =int(true_love)

    print(f"Your score is {num_true_love}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
