#Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

#It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

#Under 18.5 they are underweight
#Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#Above 35 they are clinically obese.

#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
#Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. 
#e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
BMI_cal = weight/ (height ** 2) 
#print(f"{weight} % ({height} x {height}) = {BMI_cal}")
BMI_whole_num = round(BMI_cal)
