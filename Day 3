#Write a program that works out whether a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, and leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
#This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

#e.g. The year 2000:

#2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
#2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
#2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
#So the year 2000 is a leap year.

#But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
#2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
#2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
#2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
